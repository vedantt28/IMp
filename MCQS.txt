A. boolean getAmount(boolean[] args)
B. public static void main(String[]) args
C. public void main(String[] args)
D. int a()
E. void a()

Answer: A, D, E

Explanation:
Valid:
boolean getAmount(boolean[] args): Allowed as it follows standard interface rules.
int a(): Valid as it declares a method without a body.
void a(): Valid, following normal interface rules.
Invalid:
public static void main(String[] args): Static methods cannot be abstract.
public void main(String[] args): This is not a recognized method for interface

Notes on Interfaces:
Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "Animal" object in the MyMainClass)
Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
Interface methods are by default abstract and public
Interface attributes are by default public, static and final
An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)
