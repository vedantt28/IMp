1) User-defined exceptions in Java are typically unchecked exceptions.
A. True
B. False

Answer: B. False

Explanation:
User-defined exceptions in Java are typically checked exceptions when they extend the Exception class. However, if they extend RuntimeException, they become unchecked exceptions.

2) Given:
java
Copy
Edit
interface Jumper { public void jump(); }
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal { Tail tail; }
class Beagle extends Dog implements Jumper { public void jump() {} }
class Cat implements Jumper { public void jump() {} }
Which three statements are true? (Choose three.)

A. Cat is-a Animal
B. Cat is-a Jumper
C. Dog is-a Animal
D. Dog is-a Jumper
E. Cat has-a Animal
F. Beagle has-a Tail
G. Beagle has-a Jumper

Answer: B, C, F

Explanation:

Cat implements Jumper, so Cat is-a Jumper (B).
Dog extends Animal, so Dog is-a Animal (C).
Beagle extends Dog, and Dog has a Tail, so Beagle has-a Tail (F).
Cat is not an Animal because it does not extend Animal.
Dog does not implement Jumper, so Dog is-a Jumper is false.
Beagle implements Jumper, but it does not have-a Jumper, so G is incorrect.

3) What will be the output of the following Java program?

public class Program1 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Runnable r1 = new Runnable()
        {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("This is a run method");
            }
        };
        Thread t1 = new Thread(r1);
        t1.start();

        Runnable r2 = () -> {
            System.out.println("My name is Sandip");
        };
        Thread t2 = new Thread(r2);
        t2.start();
    }
}
A. Compilation error
B. Runtime error
C. This is a run method My name is Sandip
D. My name is Sandip This is a run method

Answer: C or D (Output order is not guaranteed)

Explanation:

The program creates two threads, each printing a message.
Since thread execution is non-deterministic, either output is possible.
The lambda expression r2 is a valid functional interface implementation.
